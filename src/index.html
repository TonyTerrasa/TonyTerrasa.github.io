            <p> Hi! I'm TJ (or Tony) and this is my personal website. Here you'll be able to find many of the activities that I design for my classes as well as some information about me. It also serves as a demonstration of my static-site web-dev knowledge. As I get better, I hope to add more features, some of which will be fairly important and others.... well bobs and whistles are always fun.   </p>

                    <p> I currently work as an English teacher, particularly for native Spanish/Castellano learners. But, true to my Engineering routes, I like to use Python and HTML for preparing my lesson materials to tell interesting stories to make meaningful outcomes for my students.
