            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This summer has been a wonderful whirlwind of adventures. School ended, I moved, and
            I jaunted right off to California for a little pre-trip to the main trip which would bring me to the Eastern
            Hemisphere. Along the way I got to visit friends and catch a little glimpse, though of course incomplete, of
            their lives. Here&#39;s a summary of my adventures, served bit by bit. </p>

           

            <h2>California</h2>
            <h3>Stanford Conference</h3>
             <p>I started the summer with an academic adventure to Stanford University for the EduNLP
            AI Practitioners Summit. Imagine you work in a lab where you make AI tools for education. You&#39;ll want to
            be sure to consult people who work in education such as teachers, paraeducators, administrators, tutors,
            etc. to make sure that the research that you&#39;re doing and the tools you&#39;re developing align with
            actual needs &quot;in the wild.&quot; That&#39;s what this summit was all about. The EduNLP lab paid for 60
            of us to go to Stanford for two days to talk about how we&#39;re using AI, how we&#39;re NOT using AI, how
            we&#39;d like to use AI, and give feedback on the projects that they&#39;ve already started. </p>

            <p>I had a blast. At school this year, I felt like it was mostly my coworker Wilmer and
            I talking about what to do about AI in education. Not just how to catch cheating or avoid writing emails,
            but how to actually grapple with what AI will do to education. Wilmer and I attended the summit together and
            got to talk to 58+ other educators and researchers about what we see the future of education looking like
            and how we can address student needs in the short term. </p>

            <p>I realized I neglected to take any photos of the conference, but here&#39;s some
            pictures of Stanford&#39;s campus. I love the architecture, and it was really sunny and nice when we were
            there. I particularly liked the big marble statues from the engineering quad. Apparently they decided where
            to put the statues by dropping a bunch of marbles from really high in a simulation and seeing where they
            would land.</p>

            <h3>Visiting Grayson</h3>
            <p> Though I have a lot of friends over in California I don&#39;t get over there very
            much, so I wanted to take advantage to visit someone. In particular there&#39;s my friend Grayson who I met
            my sophomore summer of college working an internship in LA. We remain in touch pretty regularly. Usually we
            have a call a handful of times a year where we talk about everything that&#39;s going on in our lives. So,
            we were both shocked to realize that we hadn&#39;t seen each other in person for something like 6
            years.</p>

            <p>Hanging out with Grayson was an awesome few days. We got to catch up in person, and I
            got to see a little slice of his life. I got to visit his work, a tech company where we had a very good
            lunch. I also got to see and help in a very small way with the van that he has been retro-fitting to make it
            a livable space. He&#39;s been going at this project for a while. It was really cool to see how it looks in
            person. </p>

            <p>Aside from seeing his life, he showed me around some of his favorite nature places including a
            hike in the forest to the </span><span class="c5"><a class="c4"

            <h2>Australia</h2>
            <h3>The Journey</h3>
            <p>I wish I could tell you that getting to Australia was a breeze. Hopped on a plane, then another plane, and then Sydney. Unfortunately, my trip to Australia was a little more complicated than that.</p>
    
            <p>My loving partner GK woke up with me at 4:30am on July 1st at her mom's house in Montgomery County to bring to the Dulles airport. Per the instinct my dad instilled in me, I got to the gate about an hour and changed before boarding, so I got my computer out to do some planning for the trip. I'm skimming through my email when I realize that my itinerary, which originally was supposed to get me to Australia in the morning of July 3rd, now says I'll be arriving on the 4th. At first I thought I misunderstood. Then I noticed that my flight itinerary had been changed ever so slightly so that instead of a 2 layover in LAX, I had a 26 layover in LAX. My mind starting buzzing. Normally, I wouldn't mind. I'd find somewhere to stay in LA and get there the next day. The problem was that Liam and I were supposed to head out from Sydney for our first Australian trip in the morning of the 4th. I'd get there 2 hours too late to get on our flights to the Whitsundays.</p>
            
            <p>What was I going to do though? I was sitting at the gate of my first flight. My bag was already in the plane. Expecting to receive a flat out reject, I called American airlines to see if they could get me there on the 3rd. Luckily, they were very nice and they said they could get me another flight. It'd just have to leave out of DCA. So, I did something I've never done before which is ask the person at the desk at the gate to get someone to retrieve my luggage from the plane. They sent my bag to one of the baggage claim carousels, and I started my hour-long metro ride to DCA.</p>
            
            <p>But wait there's more... I was on the metro to DCA when I got another email. My flight's been canceled again! The automatically booked flight gets me there too late. I called up American and they again changed my flight for no cost. After some talking with the agent over the phone, checking the weather forecast that seemed to be canceling flights out of DC in the afternoon, I decide at 11am to get a 1:40pm flight out so I'd get to Sydney on time and miss the storm in DC. 20 in-flight and 7 layover hours later I touched down in Sydney.</p>
            
            <p>I landed in the morning in Sydney. Liam, my friend from college with whom I would spend the rest of July traveling Australia, happened to be there saying goodbye to his girlfriend. Liam, a New York native, is living in Sydney, and his girlfriend happened to be heading back to the states the morning I arrived.</p>
            
            <p>That day was mostly occupied by me recovering from the trip and getting ready for our trip to come. We had breakfast in the morning upon arrival. While Liam was at work, I packed my carry-on for our upcoming trip. I got a run in at the park near his house, and we finished off the night going to an Australian pub for a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-05/where-the-chicken-parmigiana-come-from/11277414">chicken parmy</a> to catch up.</p>

            <h3>Boat Tour</h3>
            <p>The following day, July 4th, we got on a morning flight which would take us to Proserpine airport after a quick layover in Brisbane. I found a couple things interesting about domestic air travel in Australia. First, to get to the airport from Liam's place in Sydney, it was actually more expensive for us to both take the train than for us to take an Uber. The Uber came out to 20-30 AUD, but each of us would have had to pay about 17 dollars just to get into the airport via the metro. We got an Uber to the airport. I also found it interesting how much more relaxed the rules are around air travel. They still have a security line, but for domestic flights there's no liquids limit and the whole process takes 10-15 minutes. We got to the airport about an hour and a half before the flight and it was very much overkill.</p>
    
            <p>We got into the tiny PPP airport in the late morning and got a shuttle from the airport to Airlie Beach, the main-land town closest to the Whitsunday Islands. These islands were the main-event of our first trip. The following day we were getting onto a three-day-two-night boat tour! We spent the night in a hostel in town. I went for a run in the morning to explore. It's a nice little tourist town. You didn't see many people swimming at the beach. I think this was because of the jellies that were present, but it had nice views. We were there in the dead of winter (July in Australia), but I imagine the town would be super lively during the summer. Being next to the beach in the morning when there weren't that many people around was super relaxing 😊. In the morning, we bought and sent some post cards and made our way to the boat!</p>
            
            <p>The vibes of the boat were pretty interesting. The boat we signed up for was meant to be a party boat. When we signed up for this, I knew this was not my vibe, but I figured that I'd be able to find my little corners of tranquility. Sleep early. Up for sunrise. That kind of thing. So, when they told us we'd been upgraded to an EVEN BIGGER party boat, I was kind of nervous. Lucky for me, it was the off-season and really what had happened was not that many people had signed up. The big boat we were on could take something like 60 people, and we were about 20 in total. The crowd came from a mix of countries in Europe and South America, but almost everyone either had been or was about to be backpacking Australia for several months (or years). The crowd skewed early 20s, but there were people all the way up to through their thirties and one guy I expected was in his 30s or 40s.</p>
            
            <p>With only twenty-something of us, there wasn't quite the energy to throw-down like I think some of them had wished, but I was content to have my seltzer and talk to people, hear their stories, and just look off the boat. The first night we basically hung out on the boat. We got to swim off the boat a little bit. We had dinner in the mess area then went up to the top deck for some light drinking games.</p>
            
            <p>Liam and I quickly got along with a medicine-oriented English couple consisting of a doctor and a dentist. They'd apparently been saving up a little bit to be able to travel across Australia for a few months, and they were nearing the end. We talked about the fact that I had surgery planned to get all of my wisdom teeth out, much to the dentist's horror. She told me that in England they don't really make you have that operation unless you're already getting infections. This turned into a conversation about the differences in incentives and quality of care between public and private healthcare systems.</p>
            
            <p>I also talked quite a bit with a guy from Oxford who'd just quit his job as a police officer, sold his house, broken up with his partner, and started traveling Australia. We talked a lot about the value of seeing the world and how difficult of a decision it was for him to do that. A lot of people in his family were very nervous about the decision. I'm not sure what I would have done in his position, but he'd clearly thought about it a lot, and I really respected the fact that in the end he chose to have a new experience.</p>
            
            <p>Liam and I also spoke at length with the Argentinian scuba instructor on the boat (more on scuba diving later). She'd also taken a leap of faith when she started to travel the world in her early 20s. She moved first the US, then to Mexico, and I'm sure I'm missing some of the details, but eventually ended up being the resident scuba instructor for the boat cruise we were on. I was thinking about how she'd gone to the US not really speaking that much English and yet when we met her, she was working and socializing in English with apparent ease. That said, she was happy to have a break and me and Liam mostly talked to her in Spanish.</p>
            
            <p>There were many more conversations including a chat about sports with a Chilean soccer player who went to the US for college on a scholarship, an informative session about Peruvian culture with a man having trouble thinking about going back to his country, and an interesting linguistic and political exploration of "New Norwegian" with a Norwegian woman of Dutch heritage. I think I'll leave it there though for now.</p>

            <h3>Whitehaven Beach and Diving!</h3>
            <p>Day two was definitely the most exciting of the day. highlight of the boat trip was the few hours we spend at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehaven_Beach">Whitehaven Beach</a>. We hiked up to the main lookout and then walked back down for some swimming time. The beach was gorgeous with its white sand made of silica. It's apparently one of the only beaches of its kind. When I got there, I took out a dive housing my dad had got me and started taking pictures with my phone of the wildlife.... It was <em>wild</em>!</p>
            
            <p>There were so many sting rays right there, just 10-15 feet from the shore. They're super calm, so you can get really close to them. It was super easy to take the photos you'll see below. There were also some small lemon sharks, but they were a little more shy, and I didn't quite get a good shot of them.</p>
            
            <p>When our time was up, we got back on the little "tender" boat that had brought us to the beach and went back to the main boat. After some lunch, we got ready to snorkel and scuba dive. Me, the medical couple, and one more guy were certified scuba divers so they took us out on a proper dive. They did offer an intro class for anyone who wanted to try for the first time and while they were doing that, the rest snorkeled at a little reef and and caught some nice views of the resident fish and coral. If I'm completely honest, I'd say the snorkeling had much better views than the scuba diving. At the surface, a lot more light gets in and the wayers were really calm. We could easily see a ton of fish. When we went down to scuba, there was less light and fewer fish. I also realized about halfway through that there was a really strong current pushing us towards where we would end the dive. I wasn't really prepared for this, and I remember once seeing a bunch of coral go by so fast I felt like I was on a bike even though I couldn't really feel myself moving. I hadn't realized we'd be doing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_diving">drift dive</a>, and spooked me a little bit. All told, I'm always excited for a chance to dive, and between the dive and the snorkeling I was really grateful to have seen that many beautiful fish.</p>
            
            <p>One thing I was actually a little disappointed about was how close we got to the Great Barrier Reef without actually seeing or diving at it. When we pulled up to the dive spot, I noticed that we were right next to one of the islands, and it was clear that we'd be diving at a site close to, but not at the GBR. Maybe next time.</p>
            
            <p>By the end of the day, we'd been hiking, snorkeling, diving, jumping off of boats, and I was really to turn in early. Around 8 o'clock when many of the others were upstairs socializing, I went to down to take a "nap" which turned into a long peaceful night of sleep.</p>
            
            <p>The following day, we had a little more swim time in the morning, we got off the boat, and me and Liam made our way back to Sydney. The next day, Liam had to begin a work trip to Melbourne. This worked out great for me, having stumbled into free accommodation in a new city. Liam left earlier in the day to be able to start working. I got to Melbourne in the evening, spending most of the day packing for the cold of southern Australia and studying up on what I wanted to do once I'd gotten there.</p>

            <h3>Melbourne</h3>
            <p>My first full day in Melbourne was Wednesday, July 9th for those who are both still reading and counting. I explored the city all day Wednesday, all day Thursday, and the majority of the day on Friday. Apparently, there's this rivalry in Australia for the best city. Some say it's Sydney, some say it's Melbourne. For reasons I'll get into later, I'm not sure I'm really able to weigh in on the subject, but I can definitely say I frickin loved Melbourne. The whole place had an artsy vibe, and of course there was the coffee.</p>
    
            <p>My YouTube-ing before getting to Melbourne had informed me that café culture is huge. I think I had three coffees, triple my daily dose, each day I was in Melbourne. The first place I went though was actually for the food. Lune Croissanterie, just a few blocks from where we were staying, is a famous spot in Melbourne for (you'll never guess) their croissants. I'd seen videos of lines out the door, so I wasn't that pressed to go, but I got up early on Wednesday and when I got there, the place had just opened and there was almost no line. The almond croissant was one of the best I"d ever had, and I had my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DyQB8rGn3CM">Melbourne Magic</a>. The Magic is a Melbourne-specific coffee preparation. Check out the link for more information. I did like it. I did perceive it to be more smooth, maybe because I was expecting it to be that way, and I got several of them while I was in Melbourne. From Lune, I visited two more coffee shops, checking out the neighborhoods along the way and asking for coffee recommendations from baristas. The peak of the coffee exploration would definitely have to be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn5cWFSJE08">Mont Blanc</a> I had at Good Measure. The Mont Blanc is a cold brew drink invented at Good Measure. It has cold foam and fresh orange zest and nutmeg (I think). I did not realize the canonical preparation was cold, and I was already freezing from being outside, so I got it hot. It was excellent. The coffee was smooth, the cold foam was nice and sweet, and you could really taste the orange.</p>
            
            <p>Other highlights included Victoria Public Library. I've been learning that I really like going to the libraries of a city. Sometimes they're pretty, as was the case in Melbourne, and sometimes they're just nice calming spaces to hang out and charge your phone. The Victoria Public Library had this gorgeous dome area in the middle. It also had a neat exhibit on misinformation. I also learned that there are a few cultural neighborhoods in Melbourne. I went out to Brunswick which is known for having some good Lebanese food. I specifically went to A1 Lebanese bakery and got a pizza with some toppings I'd never had before. It was delicious.</p>
            
            <p>Another thing I found interesting is from what I tell, in Australia they have a slightly different idea of the "suburbs" than we do in the US. They have what they call the Central Business District (CBD), which is the downtown, and it almost seemed to me like everything else is the suburbs. For example, I'd heard people refer to where I got the pizza as the "suburbs," but it was easily accessible by public transit and the density was something like parts of Brooklyn, which though not Manhattan, I think most people in the US would still call part of NYC.</p>
            
            <p>On my third and last night in Melbourne, I was a little bit at a loss for what to do. I'd traveled out of the CBD to go to the botanical gardens, but it'd closed early for something called "Lightscape." I didn't think I would like it at first, so I walked over to a nearby monument to watch the sunset. As I was sitting on the steps to the moment, I was thinking about how crazy it was that I was there in Australia, and that I did really want to see the botatnical gardens. I mean, when's the next time I'm going to be in Melbourne? So, I paid the 45 AUD and saw a really neat show. They'd decked out the whole botanical gardens with different lights. Some installations had musical accompaniment, and by the end, I was so glad I'd opted to do it. When I'd finished walking Ligthscape, it was time to head over to Uptown Jazz café for a show.</p>
            
            <p>Friday, Liam worked most of the day, and I took advantage to get some more coffee and see the Melbourne Museum. When he got out of work around 5, we began our Great Ocean Road adventure...</p>

            <h3>Great Ocean Road</h3>

            <h4>Great Ocean Road (the Beginning)</h4>
    
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road">Great Ocean Road</a> is, as you can imagine, a long road that goes along the coast. It's kind of the answer to the question "what did Australians veterans do when they got home from WWI?" It is literally called the "Great Ocean Rd," and it is beautiful. The majority of the road goes along the coast, and you get a stunning view of cliffs, rocks big and small just off the coast, and the waves crashing on the shore.</p>
            
            <p>We set off from Melbourne around 6pm or so after Liam got out of work. Since it was the middle of winter, it was already dark, so there wasn't much to see. We picked our pick-up truck (a "yute" in Australia) and drove straight to our first accommodation in Anglesea, which I spent far too long reading as "Angel-sea" in my brain. The website said it was a hostel, but it was more of an entire cottage with a kitchen and everything. Me and Liam got in, made our plan for the day, and went to sleep.</p>
            
            <p>The following morning, we got right to work. Throughout most our travels, Liam and I mostly ate by getting groceries and preparing our meals in the hostels. GOR was no different. We stopped by the grocery store, came back to the hostel to prepare a breakfast of oats and a lunch of chicken sandwiches. Thing is, we were planning on frying the chicken breasts, but we realized when we got back that we didn't have any oil. Liam and I chose different preparations styles, and mine was definitely.... Creative. Too much water. Lunch tasted good though.</p>
            
            <p>Around 10 o'clock we hit the road, stopping along the way to take some pictures at some cliffs and a light house. We also went to Otway National Park to do a hike. In my opinion, one of the highlights of any road trip is the chance to sit and talk with someone for a few hours uninterrupted. Liam was a great person to roadtrip with. We talked about a bunch of things including our life goals, education, and what motivates us to be better. I definitely felt our friendship get strong as it does on a roadtrip 😊</p>
            
            <p>The goal was to make it to the 12 Apostles for the sunset. The 12 Apostles are a collection of almost 12 big rocks off the coast just southeast of Port Campbell. We made it by sunset, but wow was it crowded. It's one of the most talked-about attractions on GOR, and the crowd matched the hyper. I'm not sure the experience matched the hype. We managed to get a picture of just us, which is just an illusion. There were people on all sides of us and we managed to snap a picture at just the right moment that it almost looked like we were alone. All in all, it was a pretty sight, but given the crowds, I preferred what we saw the following morning.</p>
            
            <p>After the sunset, we made a quick trip to the Port Campbell grocery store and settled in for the night. Port Campbell, like just about all the GOR towns we passed through, consists of just a couple of streets of houses and one main street. So, I'm fairly sure I'm right about it being <em>the</em> Port Campbell grocery store. We had dinner and settled in for the night.</p>

            <h4>Great Ocean Road Day 2</h4>

            <p>We started day 2 for GOR with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Bridge_(Victoria)">London Bridge</a> and the Bay of Martyrs. London Bridge used to be a pair of natural archways that you could walk across and watch the ocean batter the cliffs below! In 1990, the first arch which connected the second to the mainland collapsed. Luckily, no one was hurt, but two people got trapped on the other side and had to be rescued by helicopter. By the time we got there, it just had the one arch, but that didn't detract from its beauty. The pictures never do the size of these formations justice, but I remember being in awe of how big and actually violent the whole spectale seemed. Wind was tremendously forceful and the sound of the waves crashing against the rock, though beautiful, were not inviting for a human swimmer. The view of the Bay of Martyrs, another rock formation, was slightly less impressive than the 12 Apostles, but way less crowded and as such, much more enjoyable.</p>
    
            <p>It was then time to head back to Melbourne to drop off our car and catch our 7pm flight to Hobart. On the way, we stopped for ice cream and to do a hike in You Yangs Regional Park. I've got to admit, the hike we did at You Yangs was a little creepy. We stopped there mostly because we wanted to do some exercise and it was on the way. When we started, everything looked normal, but the more we progressed, the more it looked like the park had recently been burnt down or something. Maybe it was just winter, but the whole place was grey. We got some good exercise though and the view from the peak was calming. I also crossed something off of my Australia bucket list though, which was to see a kangaroo. We were just about to the end and we saw a bunch of them just off the path we were using to get back to the car. I'm sad to say, I don't have any photos though. When we saw them so close, I got a little scared. There's all sorts of stories of drunk Australians getting the lights beat out of them by trying to fight a kangaroo. I was neither Australian nor drunk, but didn't want to make anyone mad. We asked a park ranger who happened to be nearby if it should be safe for us to continue along the path at that distance from the kangaroos. He said it shouldn't be a problem, but nonetheless, Liam and I went by, admired the marsupials in passing, and headed for the car.</p>
            
            <p>We returned the Yute and made our flight to Hobart, the capital city of Tasmania, with no problems. However, by the end of the hike I was starting to feel a little more winded than usual. I was also starting to feel an itch in my throat that I was desperately trying to ignore. The hostel in Hobart was simple and cozy enough, and we slept well.</p>

            <h3>Tasmania</h3>

            <h4>Hobart</h4>

            <p>Our morning in Hobart was productive. I start the morning with a run, and Liam went to the gym. At this point, we'd been on the road with the 7kg (15 lbs) of carry-on luggage allowed by JetStar Airlines for about a week. We needed to do some laundry. Funny enough, there didn't seem to be any laundromats showing up nearby on Google Maps, but there was a "Machine Laundry Café" just a few blocks away. "You think they have laundry machines there?" I said jokingly, but upon further investigation, we found out they DID in fact have laundry machines there. So, we checked out of the hostel and had breakfast at the café while our laundry was washed and subsequently dried in the adjacent room. The whole shop seemed kind of gimmicky, but it was exactly what we needed and I was relieved to wash enough underwear to make it back to Sydney.</p>
    
            <p>After that, we got the rental car from the airport and headed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruny_Island">Bruny Island</a>. Bruny is a small island off the southeast coast the island (Tasmania) off the southeast coast of Australia. It's made up of two land masses, North Bruny and South Bruny, connected by a small strip of land called the neck. It's got one main road that runs from where the ferry drops you off in the north all the way down through the neck and to the southern part of the island. We were staying in South Bruny, so we took the ferry, and stopped by a famously fresh oyster stand called "get shucked" for my first fresh oysters ever. To me, they mostly tasted like salt water. So, they were good, but not necessarily something I'd order at a restaurant, or so I thought. The ferry was a really neat experience. I don't remember before being on a boat in a car. We were first in line. I guess another ferry had just taken off, so we got out and looked at the views for a few minutes before getting back in our car to get onto the boat that would take us to the island off an island off an island.</p>
            
            <p>That night I think we had the best accommodation of the trip. We were in a cabin just a 5 minute drive from a beach. The cabin had a little kitchen, a dining space, and a cozy living and sleeping area. At the time we settled into the cabin, we had done our morning in Hobart, gotten the car, made it to the ferry, eaten oysters, and checked out the nearby beach. I was starting to feel a little low on energy, but it was already dark so we made dinner and got to bed.</p>
            
            <p>Right when we got to the cabin, I checked something else off of my bucket list which was to see a wallaby. I learned when I got to Australia that a wallaby looks like a small kangaroo, and there were a bunch of them just outside our cabin when we got there!</p>

            <p>In the morning of our second day we did what I thought was the coolest thing we did in Tasmania, a Bruny Island Cruise. We met at the Bruny Island Cruise building a bit before 11am to get checked in. We headed down to their speedboats that then took us on a tour of the cliffs on the coast of South Bruny. It was an amazing experience! There was a hilarious tour guide who didn't stop making jokes until we stepped foot back on land. We saw rock formations, blowholes (partially underwater caves that shoot a spray with the sway of the water), whales, seals, and even made it all the way down to the beginning of the Southern Ocean.</p>
            
            <p>The Southern Ocean honestly made me respect the term "choppy waters" more than I ever had before. We turned the southeast corner of the island, and, just as the guide had warned us, the waters changed almost immediately. The water was much more open, the wind much more intense, and the waves seemed to build up over horizontal distances you'd measure sports fields in. Thankfully, I felt safe the whole time. The guide-comedian-captain of the boat showed off his skills, maneuvering us through, around, and over the waves with ease. But, I for the first time witnessed first-hand how had we been in a slightly smaller boat or less able hands, the ocean easily would have overcome us and left us stranded.</p>
            
            <p>Cliffs admired and ocean respected, we made it back to shore, had a quick coffee, and made our way to our next accommodation. It was at this point that I realized I was definitely about to be quite sick. I'd worn 3 layers of shirts, a jacket, two layers of pants, and double socks on account of how cold they said it'd be on the boat. However, we got off the boat, and I proceeded to shake until several hours later when I'd been baking beneath the covers in a bed with a heating pad and the space heater on full blast for some time. I was out for the night. Liam went to the gym and graciously made dinner.</p>
            
            <p>The following day, it was more of the same. I had a later, cheaper flight than Liam, so I spent a little more time in Hobart, which I'd hoped to spend exploring the city. However, I actually spent the afternoon drinking electrolytes and reading in the Hobart library. Not a bad time.</p>
            
            <p>I made it back to Sydney in the evening, craving the bed in Liam's guest room and Tim Tams (Australian chocolate biscuits). I fell asleep a little worried about the next couple of days. I knew I would get sick if I took to the wintery southern hemisphere during summer break.</p>

            <h3>Sydney</h3>
            <p>The next couple days are a bit hazy. I was feeling really gross for the first 24 hours. Liam left the morning after we got back for a college reunion. I'd opted not to go because I went last year, it was in Las Vegas, and was going to take advantage to see a little more of the eastern hemisphere. He was kind enough to let me crash at his place for a few more days which I was going to use to explore Sydney before heading off to Singapore. At this point I was actually quite nervous about going to Singapore. They're known for having very strict rules, and I was worried about being denied entry for being sick. You self-declare your sickness status, but in a country where gum is banned and they can sentence you to death for having too much weed on you, I didn't want to get caught lying on my entry paperwork. So, I bunkered down for the first day and a half, had my electrolytes, and read.</p>
    
            <p>The day before I departed for Singapore, I was feeling a little better and felt I really had to see at least a little bit of Sydney. So, I slept in, had a big breakfast and headed out for a few recommendations Liam had left me. I went to Newtown, a sort of hipster neighborhood, for a coffee and a sit in the park. I then went to the botanical gardens downtown, which had a lovely view of the Opera House. I was feeling a little tired and my phone was about to die when I got there, so I found a little rock formation to sit on, and read until the sun set behind the Opera House.</p>
            
            <p>When I was in Newtown, I went for a coffee at Shenkin Espresso Bar. It's a small shop situated on a streetcorner, simply but tastefully decorated with a counter to order coffee at and a row of 4-5 window seats. I sat to have my coffee and the co-owner Ben asked me how I was doing. Before I knew it, I'd had a 10-15 minute conversation with him while his brother manned the counter and prepared coffees for other customers. He was maybe in his later 30s or early 40s and his family of several brothers and sisters immigrated to Australia when he was a teenager. He's from Israel, a fact that he presented with the calm and joy of someone who is comfortable with himself and loves his family, but with the weight of someone who's aware of the world and has had that fact received poorly. We danced around the politics of it, finding it sufficient to say bad things were going on there. I asked if he had any family there and if everyone was alright. They are. He asked about my family and why I was in Sydney. At the end of the conversation, he gave me a chocolate croissant which he at least said was his father's recipe. It was amazing and rich and chocolatey. I sat and read and listened as he received other customers, including some who I inferred were regulars with an intimate kindness and warmth. Eventually, I said goodbye, and walked towards the park, reveling in the power of person-to-person connection. When he'd said his family was from Israel, I felt a bolt of anxiety shoot down my spine. What should I think of this person? Should I feel animosity towards him for policies of his country I don't agree with? Should I feel a kinship for someone I could likely assume is a fellow Jew? At the same time, aside from his country of origin, I didn't really know very much about him. He knew nothing about me. Yet here he was, serving me a coffee and showing genuine interest in my foreign origin that he'd gathered from my accent. It was nice to just enjoy the connection and conversation. To get to know someone and see them as a person. I know we can't always ignore politics. I'm also aware that the ability to blissfully pretend they don't exist for a moment is a vestige of the privilege I was born into. All the same, it was a nice interaction. Made me want to be a regular somewhere.</p>
            
            <p>So, I didn't get up to quite as much exploring in Sydney as I'd like, but I still had a good time. Aside from the conversation and the wonderful pastry, I finished a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Chambers#Wayfarers_series">Becky Chambers</a> series I'd been working on called the Wayfarer Series. I don't read classics or do sophisticated analysis, so I couldn't tell you about the originality or the nuances of her style, but I can tell you it was really nice optimistic science fiction with queer characters that made me smile a lot. I devoured the last book and felt a little sad at the end, wondering how I could find more feel-good queer SciFi.</p>
            
            <p>The morning of July 19th, I finished doing some laundry, packed up my bags and prepared for my Scoot Airlines flight, hoping they'd let me into Singapore when I landed.</p>

            <h3>Singapore</h3>
            <p>Scoot Airlines is the Spirit Air/Frontier/RyanAir/Name-Your-Budget-Airline of flights that take you in and out of Singapore. I had a hunch this might be the case when I booked, as they were by far the cheapest flights even taking account for the fact that I'd have to pay some relatively steep fees for baggage. This is okay. I knew what I was getting into, mostly. I will say though, I was not quite expecting to pay for water on an 8-hour flight. I begrudgingly forked over a couple bucks after depleting my own water for another bottle a few hours before landing thinking that my sore throat would be worse off if I didn't. When we got in, it was about 8pm and I nervously approached immigration. I hoped and hoped that they wouldn't refuse me entry because I said that I'd had a cough in the last few days on my digital entry card. To my surprise, I didn't even have to talk to a human. I scanned my passport at one of these fancy immigration posts, they scanned my face, and let me in. I was looking for the booths where they might stamp my passport and realized I was at baggage claim. So, I claimed my bag, worked my way to the train station, and started my hour-long public transit ride back to the hostel I was going to stay at.</p>
            
            <p>When I got off the train, I was immediately struck by the change in both temperature and humidity. It'd been winter when I left Australia. I stepped out of the train station into a tropical evening at about 80 degrees or so. It was amazing. I was more comfortable. I felt like I could breathe better. I didn't love that I was carrying all my stuff and starting to sweat because of it, but I didn't even really care. I checked into the room I would share with up to 7 other people at a time, left my stuff in the locker, and ventured out for sustenance. I found a small food center on the nearest street corner, which was serving something I'd seen on the plane but hadn't dared to try: Nasi Lemak. After a little hiccup where I had to find an ATM to get cash out of, I had my S$5 (3.75 USD) Nasi Lemak, consisting of a piece of meat, egg, and some noodles. I showered and got to bed.</p>
            
            <p>The next morning, I woke up around 8am eager to start exploring, but in need of coffee. I'd had some trouble getting to sleep because I was too busy hacking up a lung. I was at this point feeling basically full energy. However, my throat was super sensitive to the AC in my room. I felt much better once I got outside though. I found a little café and enjoyed my coffee while I made sure I had a list of what I wanted to do. I'd done some studying before getting here, and I based my first day in Singapore off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfBzECyIeVw">this video</a> by DashingHeights, who had a bunch of useful information on his channel.</p>
            
            <p>One thing to know about Singapore is it has a variety of cultures coexisting in the same city. There are the Malay people who are recognized as the indigenous people. There is also a big population of ethnically Chinese people, a group of people from southern India, as well as some influence from Europe and other countries. Just about all public signs will appear in four languages: Malay, Tamil, Mandarin, and English. In the touristy center, you'll find several cultural neighborhoods, and these neighborhoods were where I headed after I got my dose of caffeine.</p>

            <h4>Kaampong Glam (Muslim Quarter)</h4>

            <p>The first stop was the Kaampong Glam, the Muslim Quarter. I went to the Sultan Mosque. The inside was very pretty, and I thought it was cool that they had extra coverings outside in case people who wanted to see had to put on some extra layers. I was in shorts and had to wrap something around my legs. I had a conversation with a man who was working there. I asked about how they knew when in the day to do each of the 5 prayers. He told me the timing for each prayer is related to the length of one's shadow, so exact times would be different in Singapore than in Sydney for example. We also talked about the role religion plays in each of our lives. He told me he uses his 5 daily prayers as regular reminders to continue being and doing good. I thought the mindfulness of the practice he described was powerful.</p>
    
            <p>After the mosque, I walked onto Muscat St. I really liked the murals, which depicted some of the history of the area. I also got a cup of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teh_tarik">Teh Tarik</a>, a preparation of milk tea popular in Southeast Asia. I really liked it. It had a specific taste that I would find myself craving late in the visit.</p>

            <h4>Chinatown</h4>
            <p>After I'd perused some of the touristy shops on Muscat St, I headed to Chinatown. Chinatown was a very busy area, right in the center of downtown. There were lots of spots to eat, several cultural buildings, and lots of places to buy trinkets. Perhaps my favorite part of walking around Chinatown was searching for murals and particularly pretty architecture. This bit of town felt much more dense than other parts, so I did not spend a lot of time in the most crowded streets.</p>
    
            <p>I did however stop at my first Hawker center. Hawker centers are basically big food courts that you'll find all over Singapore. For under S$10 ($7.50 USD). I found these centers to be among the most exciting parts of Singapore. Each time, I would spend maybe 5-10 minutes looking at all the stalls to find what looked best, or where everyone was lined up. If there are a lot of people lined up, the food has to be really good. I went specifically to Maxwell's Hawker Center in Chinatown. I had Hainanese chicken on rice, which you'll see below. It doesn't look very impressive, and I admit I'm not sure I'd wait 45 minutes for it again, but the sauce it's in and the preparation of the chicken were exquisite for the money. I ate basically every meal at a Hawker center in Singapore.</p>

            <p>After Chinatown, I had been walking around all morning, and needed something calming to do. I was getting used to the fact that I was just going to be sweaty all day. This meant I needed to drink a lot more water than I had been drinking in Australia. Luckily, I didn't have much trouble finding potable water refill stations!</p>
    
            <p>I continued my walk, but headed towards the Esplanade Theatres and the Helix bridge. This would take me around the north side of Marina Bay towards a slightly less densely packed part of the city. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade,_Singapore">Esplanade Theatre</a> is a pair of buildings where they host art shows and activities. It also has a convenient public bathroom and I'd heard there was a rooftop where I would be able to find some peace and quiet. I think at this point, I was starting to feel a little overwhelmed by all the noise of the city. Despite Singapore being called "The Garden City" I wasn't finding much garden for me to sit and relax in. I saw a lot of flowers and delicately curated plant arrangements at the tops of buildings, but not that many places to sit in the grass and not be surrounded by cars.</p>
            
            <p>As I was entering the Esplanade Theatre, I thought I heard something jazzy playing on the speakers. "How cool that they're playing jazz here in their arts building" I thought. A minute later, I thought "wow that sound system is really good, the music almost sounds like it's being played live..." When I heard the applause of an undeniably real live crowd, I decided to follow the noise until I found that there was an open area in the middle floor of one of the buildings with a man playing stride piano to a full crowd of visitors. There were no available seats, but sat against a wall and sat as the American man finished his set. When I got up, I felt reenergized. On my way out, I noticed a poster advertising their "Jazz in July" with daily jazz programming including the show I'd just sat in on and a big band show later this evening! My phone's battery was running low, so I put it airplane mode and headed for the Helix bridge.</p>
            
            <p>The Helix bridge is just a footbridge, but it has a neat shape and connects the north side of Marina Bay with the Gardens by the Bay, which were my next stop. The Gardens by the Bay were just what I needed at that moment. While I wasn't able to find anywhere without the background noise of other people, the crowds were less packed, and I was able to find a grassy field to sit on for a little bit. The gardens also house the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_by_the_Bay#Supertree_Grove">Supertree Grove</a>. The supertrees are these huge metal tree-sculptures outfitted with a ton of lights. Every night, they have a show with lights and music. It was recommended on several lists and blogs, so I thought I'd check it out. The show was really cool, but I honestly had mixed feelings about it. It felt weird to me that they would make such unapologetically inorganic and obtrusive structures a centerpiece of the gardens. I often look to parks as a reprieve from the bustle of the city, and this did not feel like that. It felt like an intentional display of technical and artistic prowess. Not particularly relaxing and slightly unnatural. On the other hand, the gardens are a tourist attraction, and they're certainly big enough that it wouldn't have been hard to find places where I wouldn't see or hear the display. I chose to be there. Happy to have checked off a must-see attraction from my bucket list, I retraced my steps across the Helix Bridge to catch the big band jazz show in the amphitheater outside the Esplanade. At this point, phone must have been around 10%, and I was definitely not going to be able to get back to the hostel without it. I turned it off and navigated by ear to the show. It was a community band, apparently the first of their kind in Singapore, and they were sick. When they finished their tunes, I caught a bus back to the hostel and settled in for the night.</p>
            
            <p>I was disappointed on the bus ride back to find out that I in fact was not cured of my sensitivity to AC yet. Getting onto the bus felt like stepping into an ice box, and I struggled to contain my coughing. I didn't want to make the others around me uncomfortable. The cough would continue every night throughout the rest of the trip until a few days after I got back in Baltimore. Thankfully, out in the humid air, everything felt great.</p>

            <h4>A Rainy Morning</h4>

            <p>In the morning of my second full day in Singapore, I had planned to visit little India. I had breakfast in the hostel, and as soon as I stepped outside, a torrential downpour ensued. I was prepared to be sweaty, sure, but that would have been a new and much less comfortable level of wet. I stayed under the cover of the walkway and found a café on the corner of the street. Some coffee would do. Funny enough though, I was still a much more comfortable temperature for me outside than it was inside, so I order my coffee to go and sat at one of the tables outside the café under the walkway covering.</p>
    
            <p>Turns out, someone else had had the same idea. She was sitting with her dog, whose cute coat served as the beginning of our two-hour-long conversation. Her husband eventually arrived as well, and I got to learn all about them and how they see Singapore. They are ethnically Chinese and are both officials in their local church. They told me about what they think works well in Singapore and what doesn't. I tried to share some of my own experience in the US as well. It was particularly interesting to talk about how they see their relationship with the government. They seem to have a high amount of trust. Things do seem to be working fairly well in Singapore. There's also a distinction made between civic and civil society. I didn't fully understand which was which, the main idea as it pertains to them is that NGOs or churches explicitly cannot be political. The only organizations that can are the parties themselves. If the government wants an NGO to run a program like a foodbank, they're simply assigned that responsibility by the political party in power. There's no ability for the NGO to lobby, but if they want to take it upon themselves to start an initiative they can do that. They also mentioned that there's some issues that aren't quite as important as in the US because the government takes care of it willingly. For example, there's fairly robust programs to make sure that everyone has affordable housing. Something like a homeless shelter, at least in their telling, is not really a necessity in Singapore. However, you might still work on a program to make sure that people have affordable access to food and home supplies. I also asked them about the idea of a Singaporean identity. Singapore in its current iteration is just a 60-year-old country, and the people that inhabit it come from such different backgrounds. They told me they didn't feel a very strong connection to a Singaporean culture per se. They acknowledged that certainly there were things, in particular they noted a materialist interest in owning a car, condo, etc. I pointed out to them the Hawker centers seemed to be fairly unique. I found this interesting. They seemed to hint that Singaporean culture was still kind of developing. To me that makes sense. Nowadays, we would absolutely say the US has a culture made up of its diverse subcultures. At the same time, the US has also been a country for a relatively short period, and I wager that many would agree that US culture feels slightly more amorphous and composite in a way that's different from the way we hear about long-standing cultures around the world.</p>
            
            <p>I also asked them for some recommendations of what to see and eat. I told them I felt like I was really only seeing the tourist center. Where are the actual Singaporeans? They recommended a particular stall at a nearby Hawker center for a UFO, or a fried oyster cake. They also gave me a recommendation for a neighborhood called Tao Payoh, which I would later go and check out in the evening.</p>
            
            <p>The rain cleared up, and I said goodbye and thanked them for the enriching and educational conversation. Little India happened to be close to where I was staying, so I left it for the following day in favor of going to see the slightly farther away Malay area. In the Malay area, I had lunch, visited the community center, and walked around. By that point I had sensed a little bit of tension towards or around the Malay community. I don't want to speak too much on this topic because I don't know enough, and it seems sensitive. What I will say is that as the officially recognized indigenous people, many Malay people receive payments from the government, and there seems to be a little bit of debate around those payments and their effects.</p>

            <h4>The Peranakans</h4>

            <p>Just south of the Malay area is a Peranakan area. I wandered around wondering exactly what Peranakan meant. It didn't seem to be an ethnic group that was commonly spoken-about. I eventually stumbled upon some pretty-looking houses and there was a S$12 museum on the second floor of the building next-door. The entry of the museum came with a guided tour, and this was perhaps one of the most interesting museums I visited on the whole trip.</p>
            
            <p>I learned that the word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peranakan_Chinese">Peranakan</a> really refers more to a life-style led by a specific group of people. The Peranakans were a group most prominent before the arrival of the British in Singapore and were the result of the mixing of Chinese tradesman and local Malay women. The word Peranakan comes from Malay and means "born here, but not from here." You can imagine the Chinese tradesman who set up chop here were quite wealthy, and the resulting culture was an extravagant mix of certain Chinese practices with local traditions. The museum was very pretty, and the guide was very kind in answering all of my questions. She told me that Peranakan culture is in a moment of revival right now. There are some practices, like the making of ornate slippers, traditionally done by the women of the family, are being revived as art forms, and they're starting to tell the story of their ancestors more. The guide herself hadn't thought of herself as Peranakan growing, and really mostly speaks English in her day-to-day life, but had become interested in her heritage and started working with the museum. I love learning about cultures that emerge from the meeting of others, so I had a really great time. I bought a few post cards.</p>
            
            <p>In the evening, I ate and headed off to Tao Payoh, where the couple had recommended I go to get a glimpse of where real Singaporeans live. The apartment buildings were huge, as I'd read they might be. The food was yummy. I'm not sure I saw or learned very much, but it was nice to see people living their lives normally. I also got a few funny looks as I stepped off the metro, which indicated to me that I was in the right place.</p>

            <h4>Day 3: Monkeys and Flowers</h4>
            
            <p>Day three was my last full day in Singapore, so I wanted to make sure to check the remaining items off of my checklist. I stopped through Little India in the morning. I stopped by the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. It was honestly a very overwhelming experience. It was super hot and there was a lot of loud noises involved in the ceremony that was going on. I had some yummy food and headed north for some much-needed nature.</p>
    
            <p>I made it to the MacRitchie Nature Trail around midday and was so excited for a hike. I was on the trail for about 3-hours and I hadn't realized how much I needed to be in a place where I couldn't hear any cars. Some of my favorite sites included some real-life monkeys, trees with huge roots, and some funky lizards. There was also a tree-top walk, a narrow bridge that took you to through the top of the canopy. I was very excited to see monkeys in person, but also a little scared. They mostly stayed to themselves, but I did see one that when I accidentally jostled the railing it was sitting on, barred some teeth at me, and I decided to keep my distance.</p>
            
            <p>After the hike, I was dying to see the Singapore botanical gardens, and they did not disappoint. The gardens are huge and filled to the brim with different types of flowers and plants, all laid out in a way where it's easy to find a little corner for yourself. This was great because by the end of the hike, I had sweat more than I had for several weeks, and moved more than I had since getting sick, so I was starting to feel a little weak. Chugged a full bottle of water and laid down in the grass, reminding myself that vacation is in fact for resting. The best way to be grateful for this opportunity to see new places was to make sure I had energy enough to appreciate them. My trip to the botanical gardens was punctuated by the amazing Orchid Garden. I gladly paid S$15 dollars thinking I'd walk around the premium area of the gardens for 30 minutes or so. It turned out there were easily two hours worth of stuff to see there, and I took my time. They had flowers I'd never seen before, and you could get quite close to many of them. Below you'll see some photos, but I'm not sure any amount of photos will really do it justice. If you know me, you know I love flowers, and this was a wonderful way to end my nature excursion for the day.</p>

            <h4>Goodbye Singapore</h4>

            <p>On my last evening in Singapore, I realized I hadn't done some of the most popular tourist attractions yet, so I popped over to Marina Bay to catch a glimpse of the Merlion statue and the big fancy mall that looks like a boat. Turns out the main Merlion was covered up for construction, so the little fountain would have to do. I sat next to the bay, looking at the skyline just thinking through my gratitude for being able to be there. I was so far away from home, and I tried not to lose sight of how special that experience is.</p>
    
            <p>The following morning, I needed to head out for my flight around 11am, so I got some more Teh Tarik, went to the post office to send some postcards, and headed for the airport.</p>
